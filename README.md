# Neural_Network_SMS_Text_Classifier
# This repository contains a neural network based Python SMS spam detection tool. It utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a deep learning model that classifies messages as either "spam" or "ham." The model uses text vectorization to convert text messages into numerical data. It also employs word embeddings, and bidirectional LSTM layers to capture contextual information from the messages to ensure effective classification. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated for accuracy. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a prediction function for practical use.
